# Amar Pet

Amar Pet is a user-friendly pet adoption platform that allows users to browse and adopt pets effortlessly. The platform is built using API-based data, ensuring real-time updates on available pets. Users can explore different categories, including dogs, cats, rabbits, and birds. The platform offers a smooth user experience, where clicking on a category button dynamically filters pets based on the selected type. Additionally, users can sort pets by price, like their favorite ones, view detailed information, and complete the adoption process seamlessly. The design is fully responsive, ensuring compatibility with desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Key Features

1. **Smooth Navigation & Category Filtering** – Users can navigate through different pet categories, and selecting a specific type (e.g., dogs) dynamically updates the displayed pets.
2. **Sort by Price** – The platform includes a sorting feature that arranges pets in ascending order based on their price.
3. **Like & Save Feature** – Clicking the like button saves the pet's image in a dedicated section for easy reference.
4. **Detailed Pet Information** – Each pet card includes a "Details" button, which provides comprehensive information about the selected pet.
5. **Adoption Confirmation & Auto-Close Message** – Upon adopting a pet, a confirmation card appears with a success message, which automatically disappears after 3 seconds.
